## Solution 


### Approach

There's a method that involves hidding a file within an image. To uncover the hidden file, you can use the `unzip` command in the terminal. In this instance, executing the command
will produce a new folder. When you navigate to this folder using the `cd` command, you'll encounter another image.

Repeat these steps iteratively until you eventually locate a file named "flag.txt."
