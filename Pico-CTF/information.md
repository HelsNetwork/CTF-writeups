## Solution 


### Approach

I downloaded the provided JPG file and attempted to check if there were any 
readable strings within it, but unfortunately, I couldn't find any. So I decided to check hint, which suggested checking the file's details. To do this, I used the `cat` command, but the contents were unreadable.

So, I decided to use an online [software](https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#strings) tool for further analysis.

There I found waht could be a base64 text.

So I decided to decode it using Cyber Chef, and it revealed the flag.
