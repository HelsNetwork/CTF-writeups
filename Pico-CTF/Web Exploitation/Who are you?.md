I started by looking at the source code, but it didn't really help me figure things out.
The message "Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!" gave me an idea. I decided to change the User-agent to PicoBrowser, and that's how I ended up on this page.

After some research, I came across this [site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) With Burp Suite, let's incorporate it into the HTTP request headers.
However, we encountered a message stating, "Sorry, this site only worked in 2018." To overcome this, we added another HTTP request header named "Date" and set its value to 2018, effectively
bypassing the check. The site then informed us, "I don't trust users who can be tracked." Utilizing the "DNT" (Do-Not-Track) header with a value of 1 for true, we included it in our headers.
Subsequently, the website content changed to "This website is only for people from Sweden." To manipulate the originating IP of the request, we add the "X-Forwarded-For" header. After 
finding a Swedish IP address through a quick Google search, we set the value of "X-Forwarded-For" to "2.66.244.0"
Finally, as the website updated its content to "You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?" we add the "Accept-Language" header with a value of "sv," representing the language code for Swedish.

Sending this complete request successfully fetched us the flag.
