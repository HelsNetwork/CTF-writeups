## Solution 


#### Initial Analysis

The link provided takes us to a simple web page that contains two rectangles, each with a button. Clicking on either button triggers a change in the background color.

I first started by reviewing the source code, I noticed that the HTTP methods used for the buttons differ. The 'Choose Red' button uses the **GET** method.

```html
<form action="index.php" method="GET">
	<input type="submit" value="Choose Red"/>
```
And the 'Choose Blue' button uses the **POST** method.

```html
<form action="index.php" method="POST">
    <input type="submit" value="Choose Blue"/>
```

Considering the differences in the HTTP methods used and the name of the challenge I decided to inspect the request made by the "Choose red" button using the Firefox browser's developer tools.

### Step 1: Capturing the HTTP header


With the  developer tools opened in the network tab, I clicked the 'Choose Red' button.

### Step 2: Changing the HTTP method 
 I resend the HTTP Header by changing the **GET** method to the **Head** method.
