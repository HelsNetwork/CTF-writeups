It says inspect me, so that's what I did. 


### Step 1:Checking  the source code

I found the first part of the flag in the HTML file.

Then the second part in the _'mycss.css'_ file.

In the _'myjs.js'_ I found a hint

`/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */`

The first thing that came to my mind the the `rebots.txt` file. I changed '_myjs.js_' in the link to '_robots.txt_'

The comments give the third part of the flag as well as a hint to find the next part of the flag. 
I searched on Google and found that the `.htaccess` file manages Apache server permissions. I replaced '_robots.txt_' by '_.htacess_'

What stands out the most about this hint is the capitalized "Store". In Mac, a `.DS_Store` file stores customs attributes. I changed '_.htaccess_' by '_.DS_Store_'
