# It is my Birthday


**Points:** 100

**Description:** I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, 
and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website. 



## Solution 


#### Step 1 

Clicking the link redirects us to this web page.

While searching on the web I stumbled upon this [article](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/). It provided 2 executable files `hello` and `erase` which have the same MD5 hash. 
I downloaded those files and changed the extension to a `.pdf` file.


#### Step 2

I uploaded the two files and got redirected to a php source code. There we can find the flag.
