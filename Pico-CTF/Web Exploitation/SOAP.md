In the challenge, we noticed the term `xxs` used as a tag, and it stands for `XML external entities.`. When I looked it up on Google, I found this [page](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe).

When we inspect the source code we find two `JS` files:

`xmlDetailsCheckPayload.js`

`detailsCheck.js`

Now that we have gathered all this information, open Burp Suite and intercept the POST request by clicking the "Detail" button on the web page.

Now, let's add this payload to the XML and resend the request. 

```<!DOCTYPE data [ <!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>```
