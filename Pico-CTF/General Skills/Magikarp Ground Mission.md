# Magikarp Ground Mission


**Points:** 30

**Description:** Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? Start the container, `ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin. Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `abcba9f7`
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Solution 

### Step 1

First, let's start the instance and then connect to the server via SSH `ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 60909` with the password `abcba9f7`.

### Step 2

 Using the `ls` command we get two files

The  `Iof1.flag.txt` file gives us the first part of the file

And `instruction-to-2of3.txt` tells us to mode in the root directory

The `2of3.flag.txt` contains the second part of the flag.

The `instructions-to-3of3.txt` file contains the instruction for the next step.

Type `cd~`. You can find the last part of the flag in the `3of3.flag.txt`
