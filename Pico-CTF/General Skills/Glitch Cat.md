 As you can see, these are hexadecimal characters. 
 To solve this challenge we have to create a simple Python script 

 ```python
hex = chr(0x61) + chr(0x34) + chr(0x33) + chr(0x39) + chr(0x32) + chr(0x64) + chr(0x32) + chr(0x65)
print("{picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_}" + hex + "}")
```

Flag 
`picoCTF{picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_a4392d2e}`
