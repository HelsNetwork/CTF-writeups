Use ssh to connect to this server

## Solution 

### Step 1

First, let's start the instance and then connect to the server via SSH. `picoplayer@picoctf.net -p <port>` then enter the given password.

### Step 2

The only clue we have is the description. After doing some research I learned that for automating tasks on Linux, we use `corn Jobs`. 

Let's check if `cron jobs` is enabled on the server by using `crontab -e`

I encountered these errors.

### Step 3

Since we are not allowed to use crontab, let's check the `/etc/crontab` file. `cat /etc/crontab`

 There I found the flag.
