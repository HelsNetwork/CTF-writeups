# First Grep


**Points:** 100

**Description:** Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.


## Solution 

Download the file then use grep to retrieve the flag


```bash
cat file | grep pico
```





Flag 
`picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_dba08a45}`
